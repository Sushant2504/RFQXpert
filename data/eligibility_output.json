        "mitigation": "Thoroughly review the indemnification clause with legal counsel to understand the scope of liability. Negotiate limitations to the indemnification obligations, such as capping the amount or specifying the types of claims covered. Ensure adequate insurance coverage (including contractual liability coverage) to address potential claims."

Increases in pay rate do not increase the proposed bill rate. This limits RFQXpert's ability to adjust pricing during the contract term to reflect rising costs.",
        "mitigation": "Carefully analyze all cost components (salary, benefits, overhead, profit) to ensure that the proposed pricing is sustainable and profitable. Factor in potential cost increases over the contract term (e.g., wage inflation, benefit costs). Consider building a contingency into the pricing to account for unforeseen cost fluctuations. Explore potential renegotiation clauses related to significant cost increases, if possible."

The Employers Liability is $500,000 while RFQXpert only has $1M, this is a problem, and CGL for property damage is $1,000,000 while RFQXpert only carries $2,000,000 total. Furthermore, subcontractors also need to meet these requirements adding a logistical and compliance challenge.",
        "mitigation": "Immediately contact the insurance provider to confirm the current policy's coverage limits and obtain a certificate of insurance (COI) that meets the RFP's requirements. Request the necessary endorsements to add MHMR as an additional insured and obtain a waiver of subrogation. RFQXpert should obtain a current COI from its subcontractors as well to confirm that they are compliant."

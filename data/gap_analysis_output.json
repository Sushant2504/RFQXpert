      "requirement": "Information Technology Audit Services",
      "current_capability": "Temporary Staffing Services, Professional Recruitment, HR Consulting, Workforce Management",
      "gap": "RFKXpert does not offer IT Audit services; their expertise lies in staffing and HR.",
      "recommendation": "Partner with an IT auditing firm or acquire an IT auditing company. Alternatively, quickly develop in-house IT auditing expertise through targeted hires and training."

    {
      "requirement": "Experience in school district information technology audits",
      "current_capability": "Experience in Healthcare and Government Staffing",
      "gap": "While RFKXpert has government contract experience, it lacks specific experience with school district IT audits.",
      "recommendation": "Highlight transferable skills from government experience and emphasize the company's commitment to quickly gaining school district IT audit expertise. Partnering with a firm that has this experience could also bridge this gap."
    },
    {
      "requirement": "References from other School Districts for IT audits",
      "current_capability": "References from Texas Health Resources and City of Dallas for staffing services",
      "gap": "RFKXpert's current references are not relevant to IT auditing or school districts.",
      "recommendation": "If partnering, leverage the partner's school district references.  If developing internal capability, pursue pilot projects with smaller school districts to build relevant experience and references."
    },

      "requirement": "Sample technology audit report",
      "current_capability": "No sample IT audit report available",
      "gap": "RFKXpert cannot provide a sample report showcasing their IT audit methodology.",
      "recommendation": "If partnering, use the partner's sample report (with permission).  If developing internal capability, develop a mock report based on publicly available information or industry best practices."

    {
      "requirement": "Detailed description of audit process and methodology",
      "current_capability": "Expertise in staffing and HR processes",
      "gap": "RFKXpert's documented processes are not related to IT auditing.",
      "recommendation": "Develop a clear and detailed IT audit methodology, potentially adapting frameworks from reputable sources like NIST.  If partnering, clearly articulate how the combined methodologies will be applied."

    {
      "requirement": "MBE/WBE participation (potentially)",
      "current_capability": "HUB Certified, NMSDC Certified",
      "gap": "While RFKXpert holds some certifications, the specific MBE/WBE requirements of the Hazelwood School District might differ and need to be addressed.  The RFP states they *may* reject proposals not meeting goals.",
      "recommendation": "Carefully review the Hazelwood School District's MBE/WBE requirements and determine compliance status.  If needed, explore partnerships with certified MBE/WBE firms or implement a strategy to increase MBE/WBE participation within RFKXpert."
    }
  ],
  "summary": "RFKXpert faces significant gaps in meeting the RFP requirements for IT auditing services.  Their core capabilities are focused on staffing and HR, not technical audits.  Partnering with an experienced IT audit firm appears to be the most viable short-term solution to address the majority of these gaps.  If RFKXpert chooses to develop in-house expertise, a significant investment in training, hiring, and process development will be required, along with a strategic plan to gain relevant experience and references."

      "gap": "While RFQXpert has been in business for 4 years, the RFP requires 3 years specifically in Temporary Staffing Services.  It's unclear if all 4 years qualify.",
      "recommendation": "Clarify the number of years specifically providing Temporary Staffing Services.  If less than 3, highlight relevant experience and expertise that compensates for this shortfall, emphasizing successful past performance with similar clients."

  "summary": "RFQXpert appears well-positioned to respond to this RFP, possessing relevant experience and certifications.  However, key gaps exist in demonstrating specific experience in all required staffing categories, detailing testing and training procedures, and clarifying the length of time specifically providing Temporary Staffing Services. Addressing these gaps by providing detailed information and potentially expanding service offerings will strengthen the proposal and increase the likelihood of success."

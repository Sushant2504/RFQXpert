  "summary": "RFKXpert faces significant gaps in meeting the technical requirements of this RFP. Their core competencies lie in staffing and HR solutions, not website development and maintenance. To submit a competitive proposal, RFKXpert needs to establish strategic partnerships with experienced web development and cloud hosting firms or rapidly acquire the necessary in-house talent.  Special attention must be given to acquiring Craft CMS 3 expertise. Addressing these gaps swiftly and decisively is critical for success."

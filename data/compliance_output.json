This creates a risk of margin erosion if RFQXpert experiences increased labor costs during the contract period. Fluctuations in the market, new compliance costs could all increase operational costs beyond the fixed billing rate. Moreover, this is a non-exclusive contract with no guarantee of work, meaning revenue is uncertain.",

Develop a contingency plan to address potential increases in labor costs, such as negotiating favorable terms with contractors or exploring cost-saving measures. Negotiate in pricing section that costs will be evaluated every 12 months."

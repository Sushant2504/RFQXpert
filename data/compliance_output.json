RFQXpert's current Employer's Liability is at $1M which is greater than the required amount, RFQXpert's current CGL Occurrence is at $2M which is greater than the required amount.

Consider negotiating a slightly higher hourly rate to offset the loss of future revenue from temp-to-hire conversions, or including a clause that if a certain percentage of workers convert, a fee might apply."

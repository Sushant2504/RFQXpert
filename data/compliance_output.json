Winning the bid will be challenging unless RFQXpert subcontracts with a Native American business. If RFQXpert were to fraudulently claim Native American status, it would be a severe legal violation.",
        "mitigation": "Do not falsely claim Native American preference. Explore partnership or subcontracting opportunities with certified Native American businesses to fulfill preference requirements. Disclose all subcontracting arrangements.

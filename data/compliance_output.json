        "description": "One-sided Contract Terms: The RFP contains several clauses that heavily favor the Hazelwood School District, such as the right to reject any proposal for any reason without liability, the right to negotiate final contract terms with any company regardless of interview status, and the district's ability to resolve inconsistencies in favor of the RFP. This creates a risk of unfavorable contract terms for RFQXpert.",
        "mitigation": "Carefully review all contract terms and conditions. Attempt to negotiate more favorable terms with the District, focusing on clauses that create significant risk. Quantify potential financial impacts of unfavorable terms during the negotiation process. Clearly define the scope of work in the proposal to minimize potential inconsistencies."

While RFQXpert is HUB and NMSDC certified, this RFP is in Missouri, meaning RFQXpert would still need to meet the standards laid out in the document to meet the requirements. If RFQXpert cannot meet these participation goals either directly or through subcontractors, the proposal's chances of success are significantly diminished.",
        "mitigation": "Actively seek out and engage potential MBE/WBE subcontractors. Document all efforts to solicit MBE/WBE participation, even if unsuccessful, to demonstrate good faith. If necessary, request clarification from the District regarding flexibility in meeting the participation goals."

        "description": "Fixed Pricing with Potential for Scope Creep: The RFP indicates that services must be furnished at the proposed fees, and no price increases will be permitted during the contract term. However, the scope of work is broadly defined, particularly the clause expecting proposers to indicate any areas where the District's IT could be assessed or improved and to provide pricing for such items. This creates a risk of scope creep, where the District requests additional services beyond the original proposal, without allowing for price adjustments.",
        "mitigation": "Carefully define the scope of services in the proposal, clearly outlining what is included and excluded. Include a change management process in the proposal to address potential scope changes and associated price adjustments. Conduct thorough due diligence to understand the District's IT environment and identify potential hidden costs."

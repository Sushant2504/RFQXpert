This is high risk because it could expose RFQXpert to significant liability far exceeding the contract value and potential insurance coverage if a serious incident occurs involving a temporary employee provided to MHMR.",

This could negatively impact profit margins should labor costs increase after the initial contract is awarded.",
        "mitigation": "RFQXpert can mitigate this risk by negotiating a contract clause that allows for price adjustments based on prevailing wage rates and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). It should also conduct thorough market research to determine the possibility of labor costs fluctuation."

Failure to do so can result in MHMR using other contractors, losing potential revenue and damaging RFQXpert's relationship with MHMR. This is moderately risky, especially during peak demand or shortages of qualified candidates.",

Develop relationships with multiple sources of temporary labor, including online job boards, professional associations, and partnerships with training institutions.  Establish clear communication protocols with MHMR regarding staffing needs and expectations. RFQXpert should consider investing in automated staffing solutions."

        "mitigation": "RFQXpert's pricing strategy should consider the potential for temporary employees to be hired permanently. The contract should reflect this when bidding rates. RFQXpert could offer a fee for the hiring of a temporary employee before the 520 hours mark."
